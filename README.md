# Pothole Detection

## Purpose
<!--Purpose of the project-->
This poject is a a pothole detection system using ultrasonic sensors installed in cars. The aim of this project is to alert drivers of potholes in roads to avoid the damages caused by potholes.

## Description
The Idea of the project is to place ultrasonic sensors on 50 cars from Careem and Uber in Jeddah to cover most neighberhoods in Jeddah. The cars will collect the data in regards to the location, depth, width of potholes detect in Jeddah roads. The data will then be transfered to google maps and users will be alerted whenver they are close to a pothole.
